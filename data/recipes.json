Stirring constantly and scraping back any foam that clings to the side of the pan, let this mixture boil for about 1 minute. Remove from the heat and let cool while, in a separate bowl, you beat the eggs until creamy. \r\n\r\nWhen the boiled syrup has cooled, beat in the eggs, salt and pecans. Pour into the unbaked pie shell and bake for about 50 minutes.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n* A little cream (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup) mixed into a pecan pie filling before baking gives it a richer, lighter texture. \r\n\r\n* For a sweeter, lighter pie: add more sugar and use fewer pecans; for a denser, less sweet pie: add more pecans and use less sugar. \r\n\r\n* The buttery flavour and the lard-induced flakiness of a butter and lard crust make it the perfect one for a perfect pecan pie. And a Southern pecan pie authority I know suggests that you roll out the dough a little thicker than usual; a thick, richly shortened crust provides an appetizing balance to the sweetness of the filling.

    "body": "Preheat the oven to 200 degrees. Oil two large baking sheets, a bench scraper, and kitchen shears or a sharp knife. Lay a piece of parchment paper or a Silpat on the counter where the canes can dry. Move one of the baking sheets to the warm oven.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in a straight-sided deep saucepan off heat, combine the sugar, corn syrup, water, cream of tartar, and salt and stir them together well. Clip a candy thermometer to the side of the pot and move it onto medium-high heat. Without stirring, let the syrup come up to 305 degrees. Using a pastry brush or a paint brush dedicated to culinary use, wash down any stray sugar crystals from the side of the pot. Ready the peppermint oil, food coloring, measuring spoons, and vegetable oil. Glove thyself with either heat-retardant gloves or snug mittens covered with disposable gloves.\r\n\r\nOnce the syrup has reached temperature, pour it out onto the room temperature baking sheet. Drizzle the peppermint oil on top, and using the bench scraper, scrape the hot candy up from the bottom and fold it over onto itself to stir it through. Once it has cooled slightly, mix in the vanilla as well. Note that the peppermint scent in the air will be strong.\r\n\r\nContinuously scrape up and stir the syrup to cool it until it becomes a pliable dough. Cut the dough in half and move one piece to the baking sheet inside the warm oven. (First, we’ll “pull” the white half of the candy cane. Then we’ll color the red half.)\r\n\r\nQuickly oil your gloved hands, as it’s now time to pull the candy. Scrape up the candy dough into one piece and, working as quickly and as continuously as you can, pull it out into a rope, double it over onto itself, and twist it together. Pull it, double it, and twist it again. Keep on going this way at a quick clip, and you’ll notice that the candy will start to take on a ribbon-y sheen. This is how the candy will turn white, so keep going until the color is pure. Embrace the upper body workout. Note that anytime the candy becomes too stiff, simply warm it up again in the oven to soften.\r\n\r\nDon’t let the candy get too hard. When it’s reached a nice white color, place it onto its baking sheet and move it to the warm oven. Re-oil your bench scraper. Take out the second tray of candy dough and pour on the red food coloring -- about a third of one of those tiny bottles for a good rich color. Use your scraper fold the candy onto itself to incorporate the color completely. Note that this side of the candy cane does not need to be pulled. Move both candy cane trays to the oven and let them warm through for about 5 minutes until pliant.\r\n\r\nOnce warm and squishy enough to work with, take both pieces of candy from the oven and roll them into logs as long as the baking sheet. Cut each log into four equal pieces. Hang on to one red piece and one white piece, moving the rest of the candy back into the oven to keep warm.\r\n\r\nOn the countertop, line the red and white logs alongside one another and begin to twist from one end, stretching as you go, making the candy canes as thin or as thick as you like. Use your oiled shears or knife to cut the length of each cane. Shape the hook of the cane, and press down on the ends to taper. Set the canes aside to cool. (Know, of course, that you could also cut into sticks, rounds, or individual peppermint sucking candy). Admire the individual quality of your handiwork.\r\n\r\nRepeat this process with the remaining 3/4 of the candy, one piece of each color at a time.\r\n\r\nAllow candy to cool until completely hard; about 15 minutes. Wrap each cane in plastic wrap to keep it from sticking. Store in an airtight jar for several months."

A microwave oven works well, as does a saucepan set over very low heat.\r\n\r\n8) Dip half of each cooled macaroon into the chocolate. Set the macaroons back on the baking sheet, and allow the chocolate to set completely before serving. To store, place in one layer in a closed container.

Substitute sweetened condensed milk, if desired.\r\nCoconut milk powder adds flavor and helps the macaroons hold their nice, smooth shape. Leave it out if you like."

    "body": "Preheat the oven to 375 or 400 degrees F.\r\n\r\nBake the potatoes until they are fork tender, about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Check them!\r\n\r\nWhile the potatoes are still hot peel and pass them through a food mill or ricer. (I find that the food mill works just as well as a ricer and is much easier to handle) onto a sheet tray lined with parchment paper. When doing this pay careful attention to keep the potatoes as light and fluffy as possible. This will aid in keeping the gnocchi light. Refrigerate the potatoes on the sheet tray until cold. This is also a very important step. If the potatoes are warm while adding flour they will require more flour which will result in a much heavier finished product.\r\n\r\nWhen the potatoes are absolutely cold, transfer to a clean work surface. Beat together the eggs and cheese and pour onto the potatoes. Season with salt. Cover generously with flour. It should look like snow on the mountains.\r\n\r\nCrumble the potato flour mixture between your fingers. Begin to knead the dough until it is a dry homogeneous mixture. The dough should feel slightly moist, but not tacky. If too tacky, repeat the snow on the mountains stage.\r\n\r\nForm the dough into a large log. Cut slices off the log and begin to roll into long ropes that are about 1-inch in thickness. Cut the ropes into 1/2-inch lengths. Cover generously with flour. Place the gnocchi in a single layer on a sheet tray dusted with flour. DO NOT PILE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER!!\r\n\r\nUse or freeze the gnocchi immediately. If freezing, place tray directly into the freezer. Once frozen, the gnocchi can be stored in plastic bags, in the freezer, indefinitely. When cooking gnocchi they can go directly from the freezer into salted boiling water.\r\n\r\nNote: It is a general practice to take gnocchi out of the water when they float. This is a big mistake. Gnocchi need to be cooked in boiling water until they float and get nice and puffy. Not cooking gnocchi long enough will also result in heavy gnocchi.\r\n\r\nP.S. These are Chef Anne \"Secrets\" to great gnocchi, use them and you will be successful every time.\r\n\r\nRead more at: http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/anne-burrell/gnocchi-with-prosciutto-spring-peas-and-chanterelles-recipe/index.html?oc=linkback"

Continue to heat (or microwave) briefly, just until the mixture is hot (about 110°F to 120°F), but not bubbling; it'll become shiny looking as you stir it. Heating the mixture to this point will dissolve more of the sugar, which will yield a shiny top crust on your brownies.\r\n\r\n4) Add the hot butter/sugar mixture to the egg/cocoa mixture, stirring until smooth.\r\n\r\n5) Add the flour and chips, again stirring until smooth.

Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.\r\n\r\n2) To make the cookies: Combine the sugars, peanut butter, shortening, salt, baking soda, and vanilla, beating until smooth.\r\n\r\n3) Add the egg, beating to combine.\r\n\r\n4) Stir in the oats and flour.\r\n\r\n5) Drop the dough by the heaping teaspoonful onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 1/2\" between them. A teaspoon cookie scoop works well here.\r\n\r\n6) Using the flat bottom of a drinking glass dipped in sugar, flatten each cookie to about 1/4\" thickness, about 1 1/2\" diameter. If you're a fan of the popular sweet/salty flavor combo, sprinkle each cookie with the tiniest amount of extra-fine salt (or to taste; you know your own tolerance for saltiness).\r\n\r\n7) Bake the cookies for about 12 to 14 minutes, until they're a medium golden brown.\r\n\r\n8) Remove them from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool. Once they're cool, wrap airtight; they'll soften if left unwrapped.\r\n\r\n9) Decide which type of filling you want to use. Each recipe makes enough to fill all the cookies.\r\n\r\n10) To make the peanut butter filling: Mix all of the ingredients until smooth; a mini food processor works well here. If you're not using a food processor, sift the confectioners' sugar before stirring it together with the peanut butter and milk or half & half.\r\n\r\n11) To make the fudge filling: Combine the chocolate chips and half & half in a small, microwave-safe bowl; or in a small saucepan. Heat until the half & half is steaming. Remove from the heat, and stir until the chips have melted and the filling is smooth; reheat briefly if necessary.\r\n\r\n12) Spread the filling on half the cookies. Top with the remaining cookies.\r\n\r\nYield: about 22 filled cookies."

To avoid heating the chocolate too much and possibly burning it, the best method is to heat until the butter is melted and the chocolate has partially melted, then remove from the heat. Stir until all the chocolate melts.\r\n\r\n2. In a separate bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until they're thoroughly combined. Add the hot melted chocolate, then stir in the remaining ingredients.\r\n\r\n3. Refrigerate the batter-like dough until it's thoroughly chilled, about 3 hours (or overnight). It needs to set and stiffen up before it can be scooped into balls.\r\n\r\n4. Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease two baking sheets, three if you have them. Or line sheets with parchment, and grease the parchment.\r\n\r\n5. Drop the cookie dough by heaping teaspoonfuls (balls about 1\" across) onto the prepared baking sheets. A teaspoon cookie scoop makes this task extremely simple. Leave about 2\" between the dough balls, as they'll spread as they bake.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the cookies for 10 to 11 minutes, until their tops are shiny and cracked. They won't crack until the very end, so keep a close eye on them; when they're cracked all the way across the top surface, they're just about done. The point is, you want these baked all the way through, but just barely; additional baking will make them crisp rather than chewy.\r\n\r\n7. Remove the cookies from the oven. After a few minutes, gently loosen them with a spatula, then let them finish cooling on the pan.\r\n\r\nYield: about 4 dozen 2\" cookies."

Preheat the oven to 300°F. Lightly grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.\r\n\r\n4. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough about 1/8\" thick.\r\n\r\n5. Use a cutter to cut the dough into shapes — leaves, stars, hearts, circles, your choice. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet.\r\n\r\n6. Bake the cookies for 20 to 25 minutes, until they're beginning to brown a bit. Remove them from the oven, and cool right on the pan.\r\n\r\n7. To make the filling: Mix together all of the filling ingredients except the milk, stirring until smooth. If the filling isn't spreadable, add a bit of the milk to soften its texture.\r\n\r\n8. Spread the bottom of half the cookies with filling; if you have a scale, about 45g is a good amount for each. Top with the remaining cookies.\r\n\r\n9. Store cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.\r\n\r\nYield: about 18 medium (2\") sandwich cookies."

To finish, position a rack about 6 inches below the heat source and preheat the broiler. Cut the haloumi cheese into thin slices, about 1/4 inch thick, and put them on a plate. Sprinkle with the oregano, pepper, pepper flakes, and reserved tomato oil; rub the oil and spices all over to coat the slices on both sides (work gently, as haloumi breaks easily). Transfer the cheese to a medium cast-iron skillet or a broiler pan.\r\n\r\n4. Broil the haloumi until the slices just start to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes, turning once with a spatula. (Watch closely as you don't want the cheese to dry out.)\r\n\r\n5. Top the salad with the haloumi. Sprinkle with the remaining 2 tablespoons mint, and serve right away.\r\n\r\nTo get a head start: Make the wheat berries, as in step 1, ahead.

Stir everything together, and add black pepper and soy sauce.\r\n\r\nFor instant cabbage and cucumber pickles:\r\n\r\n1. cut out the tough vein of the cabbage leaf, and slice the rest into strips. Sprinkle the cabbage and cucumber with the salt and massage well with your hands until the vegetables go limp. Let rest for at least 5 minutes. Add a squeeze of lemon juice.\r\n\r\n2. Squeeze out any excess moisture before packing into a bento box. I like to put the pickles in a bento divider cup or cupcake liner to prevent the flavors from mingling with other flavors in the box.\r\n\r\nFor Blanched Broccoli:\r\n\r\n1. Put just enough water in a small pan to cover the broccoli. Bring the water to a boil, add a pinch of salt, and put in the broccoli florets. Boil for 2-3 minutes, drain the water, and run cold tap water over the broccoli to cool quickly and fix the bright green color. Drain well. Use broccoli and cherry tomatoes to fill in gaps in the bento box."

    "title": "Tamagoyaki Bento",
    "body": "For Basic Tamagoyaki:\r\n\r\n1. Mix together all of the tamagoyaki ingredients, except for the oil, until the egg yolk and white are amalgamated but not frothy.\r\n\r\n2. Heat up the frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour in some oil and tilt the pan to spread it around. Take a small wad of paper towel and rub it around the pan to soak up any excess oil. Put the oil soaked wad on a small plate next to the stove.\r\n\r\n3. Use cooking chopsticks or a fork to draw a little of the egg mixture along the bottom of the pan. If the egg cooks immediately, the pan is hot enough and ready to go. If the egg browns too fast, cool the pan down by putting the bottom of the pan on a moistened kitchen towel, and lower the heat a little.\r\n\r\n4. Pour a thin layer of the egg mixture into the hot pan. Tilt the pan to spread it around the bottom. Pierce any large bubbles that form with the chopsticks or fork.\r\n\r\n5. As soon as the egg starts to set, start rolling it to one side of the pan. Flip one end over with the chopsticks or fork and keep flipping until you have a skinny roll. If you can't roll the egg, you can just push it along to one side until you have a skinny little omelette.\r\n\r\n6. Leaving the first roll at one side of the pan, rub the oil-soaked wad of paper towel firmly along the bottom of the pan. This adds just enough lubrication while also cleaning up any stray bits of egg.\r\n\r\n7. Add a little more of the egg mixture to the pan, tilting the pan around to spread it. Life the first roll up a little so that the uncooked egg runs beneath it.\r\n\r\n8. Puncture any large air bubbles that form, as before. As soon as this layer starts to set on top, roll it around the cooked egg roll to the opposite side of the pan. As before, if the egg is browning too fast, place the pan on a moistened towel for a few seconds.\r\n\r\n9. Repeat the preceding three steps until the egg mixture is all used up. The thinner the layers, the more delicately textured the tamagoyaki will be. Try to do a minimum of 4-5 layers.\r\n\r\n10. When the tamagoyaki is done, turn seam-side down into the pan and press briefly to seal it. Flip the egg out onto a sushi mat or paper towel.\r\n\r\n11. Roll the sushi mat or towel around the tamagoyaki, forming a rectangular shape. Leave to cool.\r\n\r\n12. Cut into even slices before packing. Garnish with parsley.\r\n\r\n13. Don't despair if your tamagoyaki doesn't quite look perfect. It will still taste great! Leftovers can be refrigerated, tightly wrapped, for a day or two.\r\n\r\nFor Salami and Cream Cheese Rolls:\r\n\r\n1. Peel the carrot and cut into strips to same thickness and length as the green beans.\r\n\r\n2. In a small pan, bring 1 inch of water to a boil. Add a pinch of salt. Put in the carrot and green beans for 3-4 minutes, until crisp-tender. Drain and cool rapidly under cool running water. Drain again and pat dry with kitchen or paper towels.\r\n\r\n3. Set aside the two best looking strips of carrot and 3 straightest green beans. Cut up the rest to sprinkle on the rice.\r\n\r\n4. (This step may need to be different due to the salami substitute) Place a piece of plastic wrap on a flat surface and lay 1 slice of salami on top of the plastic wrap so that a short side is closest to you. Spread the salami with all the cream cheese. Place the 2 strips of carrot and 3 green beans half an inch from th eedge closets to you. Roll the salami around the vegetables as tightly as you can, using the plastic wrap to aid you if needed. Roll the second slice of salami around the first roll. Wrap the roll tightly in plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\r\n\r\n5. In the morning, unwrap the roll and cut into even pieces a little shorter than the height of the bento box.\r\n\r\nFor Rice:\r\n\r\n1. Pack rice into bento box and sprinkle with the vegetables.\r\n\r\nFor Garlic Sauteed Spinach:\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oil in a pan over medium-high heat. Add the chili, whole, and stir for a minute. Remove the chili and reserve.\r\n\r\n2. Add the spinach and stir-fry rapidly. It will shrink down in mass in no time. Season with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\n3. Turn out into a fine-mesh colander to drain off any excess moisture, and leave to cool. Pack into a bento divider cup or cupcake liner. Use the reserved whole red chili as decoration if you like--though you may want to leave it out if you think the bento recipient may eat it by mistake."

Add cream of tartar and salt and beat at medium speed until whites form very soft, billowy mounds. With the mixer still at medium speed, beat in 3/4 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until all sugar is added and whites are shiny and form soft peaks. Add vanilla, lemon juice, and almond extract and beat until just blended.\r\n\r\n4. Place flour-sugar mixture in a sifter set over waxed paper. Sift flour-sugar mixture over egg whites about 3 tablespoons at a time, and gently fold it in, using a large rubber spatula. Sift any flour-sugar mixture that falls onto the paper back into the bowl with the whites.\r\n\r\n5. Gently scrape batter into pan, smooth the top, and give pan a couple of raps on the counter to release any large air bubbles.\r\n\r\n6. Bake until the cake is golden brown and the top springs back when pressed firmly, 50 to 60 minutes.\r\n\r\n7. If cake pan has prongs around the rim for elevating the cake, invert pan onto them. If not, invert pan over the neck of a bottle or funnel so that air can circulate all around it. Let the cake cool completely, 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\n8. To unmold, run a knife around edges, being careful not to separate the golden crust from the cake. Slide cake out of pan and cut the same way around removable bottom to release, or peel off parchment or wax paper, if used.\r\n\r\n9. Place the cake, bottom-side up, on a platter. Cut slices by sawing gently with a serrated knife. Serve the cake the day it is made.\r\n\r\nRead more: http://www.livestrong.com/recipes/the-best-angel-food-cake-cooks-illustrated/#ixzz4PHieOlr4"

    "body": "Make tiny cuts along the inside of each shrimp (opposite site to where the vein was) and gently pull the shrimp straight. This is an optional step, but it does make the shrimp look much bigger.\r\n\r\nPat the shrimps dry, and season with a little salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nPut the potato starch in one plate, the beaten egg in a small bowl, and the panko bread crumbs on another plate. Have another plate ready, lined with a couple of paper towels.\r\n\r\nHeat 1/2 inch of vegetable oil in a small frying pan over high heat. The oil is hot enough when a panko bread crumb dropped into it turns light brown right away.\r\n\r\nWorking rapidly, coat the shrimps in the cornstarch, dip in the egg,then roll in the bread crumbs. Try to do this with one hand, leaving the other hand clean to hold a pair of chopsticks or tongs to turn the shrimps. Gently put the shrimps one by one into the hot oil. Turn after a minute, and cook for another 30 seconds to a minute on the other side. The shrimps should feel firm when lightly tapped with the chopsticks.\r\n\r\nAs soon as each shrimp is cooked, remove from the oil and drain on the paper towels. When the last shrimp is removed from the oil, turn off the heat. If you're using an electric range, take the pan off the still-hot heating element for safety.\r\n\r\nLeave the shrimps to cool thoroughly before packing into a bento box.\r\n\r\nPut the dipping sauce of your choice in the sauce cup, to tuck into a corner of the bento box. Tartar sauce, mayonnaise, sriracha sauce, ketchup, Japanese brown sauce (tonkatsu sauce), sweet chili sauce and ranch dressing all go well with fried shrimps.\r\n\r\nAhead of time note: Bread the shrimps and freeze in a single layer, ideally on a metal baking sheet. Once the shrimps are frozen stiff, pack them in freezer bags or containers. Frozen breaded shrimps should be cooked for 2-3 minutes longer than fresh."

As the mixture comes together add 10 ounces of the flour, along with the yeast and salt and continue whisking until combined.\r\n3. Remove the whisk attachment and replace it with a dough hook. Add another 4 ounces of the remaining flour and knead on low speed for 5 minutes. At this point the dough should feel soft and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, add a bit more flour (one ounce at a time). Knead on low for another 5 minutes or until the dough clears the sides of the bowl.\r\n4. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface; and form dough into a smooth ball. Transfer to a large bowl that has been lightly lubed with the vegetable oil. Rotate the bowl so that the dough ball is evenly covered. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and set aside until the dough doubles in volume, about 3 hours. (Exact times will vary depending on the temperature of the room and the temperature of the ingredients.)\r\n\r\nFOR THE FILLING\r\n\r\n1. Combine the brown sugar, cinnamon and salt in a medium bowl and set aside.\r\n\r\nTO ASSEMBLE\r\n\r\n1. Butter a 9 by 13-inch glass baking dish with the cold butter.\r\n2. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a rectangle with the long side nearest you. Then use a rolling pin to shape into 18 by 12-inch rectangle.\r\n3. Brush the dough with the the melted butter, leaving a 1-inch border along the top edge.\r\n4. Sprinkle the brown sugar mixture over the dough, also avoiding the top border.\r\n5. Gently press the filling into the dough. (If you tend to have hot hands, you may want to cover the filling with a layer of plastic wrap first.)\r\n6. Beginning with the long edge nearest you, roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder. Firmly pinch the seam to seal and roll the cylinder seam side down. Very gently squeeze the cylinder to create even thickness.\r\n8. Using a serrated knife, gently cut the cylinder into 2-inch rolls; yielding 8 pieces.\r\n9. Arrange rolls cut side down in the baking dish; cover tightly with plastic wrap and store in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 16 hours.\r\n\r\nTO BAKE\r\n\r\n1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees F.\r\n2. When the oven has reached 200 degrees F, turn it off and place the rolls in the turned-off oven. Let the rolls rise until they look slightly puffy, about 30 minutes.\r\n3. Without taking the rolls out of the oven, increase the oven temperature to 350 degrees F and let the rolls continue to bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190 degrees F. Remove the rolls and let cool while you make the icing.\r\n\r\nFOR THE ICING\r\n\r\n1. Whisk the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer until creamy. Add the milk and whisk until combined. Sift in the powdered sugar, and whisk until smooth. Spread over the rolls and serve immediately.\r\n\r\nNotes\r\n\r\nIn case there are leftovers, arrange them on a plate and cover thoroughly with plastic wrap for up to 3 days. To reheat, move to a small plate (I usually use a paper plate) and microwave on high for 30 seconds. Two rolls can be reheated this way, three may require a few seconds more. Four will ... let's face it, you're not going to have that many left over and you know it.\r\n\r\nTo freeze: Individually wrap the rolls in plastic wrap and place them in a zip-top freezer-safe bag. When ready to eat, uncover and defrost on the counter for an hour. Then microwave for 30 seconds."

Toast panko breadcrumbs in a small pan until golden (they will gain more colour in the oven). \r\n3. Cut tofu into thin blocks; ideally equal to # of servings, but if the tofu blocks are narrow, twice that.

Cut a square of cling film slightly larger than your nori sheet. Place it on the table, place the nori sheet on top with the shiny side down and rotated 45° in relation to the cling film.\r\n2. Wet your hands (keep a small bowl of water handy to wet your hands) and grab a handful of rice.

Season well with salt. (Ideally, use an onigirazu mold.)\r\n3. Top with tofu, mayo, then veggies, and finally a second layer of rice.\r\n4.
